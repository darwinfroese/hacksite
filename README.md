# HACKSITE

Hacksite is my take on the typical TODO list for agile project development. Focusing on simple and achievable evolutions of your project containing only four tasks at a time you won't see a possibly overwhelming amount of stuff to do hopefully making it easier to complete your projects.

## Contributing

Before contributing to Hacksite, please read the contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/darwinfroese/hacksite/wiki/Contributing). 

The current project in progress is [the beta release](https://github.com/darwinfroese/hacksite/projects/1) of Hacksite which is targetted to be completed by the end of October.

## Building

Hacksite comes with all of the scripts needed to build the project. Simply run `make local` or `make.bat default` to get the project running on your local machine.

More information can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/darwinfroese/hacksite/wiki/Building).
